## Disclaimer

This project is not affiliated nor approved by Riot Games.

It won't be flagged as a cheat by Vanguard because it doesn't inject itself or read the game's memory.

It requires a server to be running, which I don't host. Here's the server project : [PuppetMaster.WebApi](https://github.com/frederikstonge/PuppetMaster-WebApi)
